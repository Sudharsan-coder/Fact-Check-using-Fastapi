The claim also stated that Pakistan had complain to ICC aganist Rasid Khan during his victory celebration with Indian flag and ICC fined him for Rs 55 lakh aganist Rasid Khan but Ratan Tata declare 10 crore to Rasid Khan.

One of the posts read: “Ratan Tata has once again shown his greatness.

Rashid Khan, Afghanistan spinner, after defeating NaPak, took the Indian flag and ran around the ground on victory lap and shouted Bharat Mata ki Jai.

NaPak complained to ICC about his action.

ICC and all other world sports bodies, as always, show staunch opposition any ‘Bharatiya’ eulogization.

ICC imposed a fine of Rs 55 lakhs on Rashid Khan.

Ratan Tata, by saying that the person who showed respect to our National Flag should be lauded. Tata announced that he would not only pay the fine amount of Rs 55 lakhs but also reward Rashid Khan with a whopping amount of Rs 10 crore.

Hail Ratan Tata 🙏🙏🙏

*Jai Hind*🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳

The above post can be seen here. More such posts can be seen here and here.

The claim started doing rounds after Afghanistan defeated Pakistan in the World Cup clash on October 23, 2023, following which the Afghanistan team took a victory lap of the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai to celebrate their historic win. During the celebration, Rashid Khan could be seen holding the Indian flag.

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim and found it to be false.

Ratan Tata on Monday took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to refute the claim.

Tata clarified that he did not make any such announcement and he has no connection with cricket.

“I have made no suggestions to the ICC or any cricket faculty about any cricket member regarding a fine or reward to any players. I have no connection to cricket whatsoever Please do not believe WhatsApp forwards and videos of such nature unless they come from my official platforms,” he wrote on X.

I have made no suggestions to the ICC or any cricket faculty about any cricket member regarding a fine or reward to any players.

Please do not believe WhatsApp forwards and videos of such nature unless they come from my official…

Hence, it can be concluded that the viral claim is false.","The claim started doing rounds after Afghanistan defeated Pakistan in the World Cup clash on October 23, 2023.

Meanwhile, a video of North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-Un speaking about the Israel-Palestine conflict has gone viral on social media claiming that he was talking about the recent Isreal-Palestine war and criticising US President Joe Biden for the conflict.

A Facebook user shared this video and wrote: “Guess Who Made A Statement About Israel-Hamas. First time Kim Jong-Un has come out to speak on global issues, this is serious.”

It is being widely shared on Facebook and X with a similar claim.

NewMobile fact-checked the above claim, and found it to be false.

Running a Reverse Image Search of the video keyframes, the NM team found the same visual in The Guardian report, dated October 2020, saying, the viral video is of the 75th anniversary of North Korea’s ruling Party, the Workers’ Party of Korea where Kim Jong-Un got emotional while speaking at a military parade in Pyongyang. He also addressed his impoverished people who have been left battered by typhoons, the coronavirus pandemic, and sanctions. Nowhere in the report, Jong-Un has addressed the Israel-Palestine conflict.

A video report by BBC, dated October 13, 2020, shows similar dress as seen in the viral video. According to the report, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un got emotional during a speech at a military parade and issued a rare apology for his failure to guide the country through tumultuous times exacerbated by the coronavirus outbreak. He also thanked his troops for their efforts against the pandemic and recent natural disasters.

Searching further, our team also found the transcript of the speech made by Kim Jong Un on October 10, 2020, which was translated into English by the Korean Central News Agency. However, there was no mention of the Israel-Palestine conflict in the entire speech. Click here to read the translated speech.

Thus, it is confirmed that the viral video is from 2020 when Kim Jong-Un gave a speech at a military parade. It was NOT related to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict.","A video of North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-Un speaking about the Israel-Palestine conflict has gone viral on social media.

Many users have shared the video mocking the demonstrators for carrying the Italian flag instead of Palestinian flag.

A Facebook user posted the viral post with a caption: Supporters of Hamas terrorists  gathered in Kerala. Instead of carrying the Palestinian flag 🇵🇸 they carried Italy’s Flag 🇮🇹. And they say Kerala has the Highest Literacy rate 😵‍💫😂😂😂

NewsMobile fact-checked the viral post, and found it to be false.

Noticing ‘Welfare Pary Kerala’ written on the main banner as well as some pamphlets, the NM team conducted a Google Keyword Search and identified the official Facebook Page of Welfare Pary Kerala and its cover photo showing a picture from their recent pro-Palestine march in Kerala.

The main white banner matches with the one in the viral video and the flags match, too. While the colours of the flag resemble the Italian flag, the official logo of Welfare Party Kerala also has the same colours as the Italian flag along with two strands of wheat and ‘Welfare Party of India’ written on it.

Searching further, our team came across a tweet on the official handle of Welfare Party Kerala showing glimpses of their protest in Kerala. We can clearly see that the protesters were carrying the flag of the party and not of Italy or Palestine.

Therefore, we can conclusively say that the viral post, claiming demonstrators in the pro-Palestine rally in Kerala carried the Italian flag instead of Palestine, is false.","A video showing a pro-Palestine march held in Kerala is doing the rounds on social media.

The post claims that she was staved for days and then was tricked into eating her own one-year-old child.

Here’s the link to the above post.

NewsMobile fact-checked the post and found the claim to be false.

We noticed the logo of Memri TV on the top left corner of the video. We then extracted the keyframes of the video and ran them through a Reverse Image Search along with a keyword search.

The search led us to a report by the Washington Times dated June 27, 2017, where the same video was present. The headline of the report read, “Vian Dakhil on ISIS horror: Yazidi slave tricked into eating own child, 10-year-old raped to death.”

According to the report, Vian Dakhil is the Iraqi parliament’s only female Yazidi member.

We also found the same video shared on ‘X’ by Memri on June 26, 2017. The video was captioned, “Yazidi Iraqi MP Vian Dakhil Breaks Down in Tears Recounting Atrocities Committed by ISIS against Her People.”

The video also had English subtitles, showing Vian Dakhil talking about atrocities committed by the Islamic State terrorists. The same was also reported by other media outlets. The report can be seen here and here.

Thus, from the above fact check, it is clear that the video is old and is not related to the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.","The video was posted on YouTube on June 26, 2017. It was captioned ‘Vian Dakhil Breaks Down in Tears Recounting Atrocities Committed by ISIS.’"

Running the video keyframes through Reverse Image Search, our team identified a YouTube video titled “DJ Bannu Dance”. The video, which has instrumental music, was uploaded by a channel named ‘Waziristan Music’, dated March 30, 2021, suggesting that the viral video is not of recent.

Searching further, we came to know that several Indian media outlets in 2021 had shared this video claiming that Taliban are celebrating after occupying Afghanistan. Also, a tweet from a Pakistan-based journalist, Iftikhar Firdous, who lashed at news channel TV9 Bharatvarsh for airing a Pakistani wedding celebration with a caption: “Unbelievable an Indian Channel is showing a viral video of marriage in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Dancers in the marriage are masquerading. The anchor shows them as the Taliban celebrating the take over of Maidan in Afghanistan. This is next level bullshit, lol.”

https://newsmobile.in/articles/2023/10/28/fact-check-2014-video-of-jews-protest-against-israeli-conscription-draft-in-new-york-viral-as-recent/,"A video showing a huge crowd of Jews gathering on the streets of New York to protest against the Israeli conscription draft has gone viral on social media. Many users claim that these Jews gathered to protest because they didn’t want to do the mandatory military service in Israel and forced conscription of the population.

A Facebook user posted the viral post with the following caption:

These images were taken in New York. Thousands of Jews are protesting against Israel. Because Jews do not want to do military service in Israel… they are forced to do military service or arrested in Israel.

Zionism and anti-Israel Torah Jews hold regular rallies to protest Israel’s conscription laws and the bullying forced conscription of Jewish men and women.

There are thousands of Jews who do not recognise the Zionist State. Why does the media never talk about them?

Zionism does not represent us! Israel is not a Jewish state! We are not part of the state of Israel. We are against Zionism. Judaism is not Zionism.

NewsMobile fact-checked the viral post, and found it to be misleading.

Running a Reverse Image Search of the video keyframes, the NM team found an article on a website CrownHeights.info, dated March 9, 2014 and titled: Tens of Thousands Protest IDF Draft in Manhattan. The photo gallery shows images similar to the keyframes in the viral video, indicating that it might be from 2014.

According to the article, thousands of Jews gathered in Manhattan to protest the Israeli government’s proposed military draft for all its citizens.

We also found a YouTube video, an unverified channel, dated March 9, 2014 and titled: 50,000 Jews United In Prayer For The Abolishment Of The Israeli Military Draft.

The video looks like a longer version of the viral clip and the keyframes starting 1:48 match the latter. Although we could not find the original source of the video, it is at least nine years old before the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.

Therefore, we can conclusively say that the viral post’s claim is misleading.",A video of Jews in New York protesting against the Israeli military draft has gone viral.

The video shows children both inside and outside the building crying for help. It also captures individuals frantically attempting to clear the debris and rescue the trapped children. Many users claim that this incident occurred recently in Palestine.

The video is shared on Facebook with a caption: “कहाँ है दुनिया के वो हुक्मरान जो इंसाफ़ की • बड़ी बड़ी बातें करते हैं ले किन जब जुल्म होता है किसी मज़लूम पर तो चुप रहते है अल्लाह फ़िलिस्तीन की गैब से मदद फ़रमा आमीन” (English translation: Where are those rulers of the world who talk big about justice but when there is oppression of the oppressed they remain silent?

NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim, and found it to be FALSE.

Performing a Reverse Image Search, the NM team traced a Facebook post carrying the extended version of the viral video, dated May 31, 2019, with a caption: “More children targeted by Assad bombs from the sky in #Idlib. Just look at how many children are injured in SYRIA ON 30 MAY 2019”. Evidently, this video is old and unrelated to the ongoing Israel-Palestine war.

We also found a video akin to the viral footage dated June 15, 2019. In this video, individuals involved in the rescue operation are attired in identical uniforms and white helmets, mirroring those seen in the extended version of the viral clip. The term ‘The White Helmet’ is visibly inscribed in this higher-quality footage on their uniforms.

The viral video had been shared on the organisation’s Twitter account, dated May 31, 2019. As per the tweet, the video pertains to the attacks in the city of ‘Ma’arrat Nu’man’ in Syria, during which five people lost their lives.

The horrified wails of children punctuate one of the last day of the holy month of #Ramadan. Today the target was #MaaretNuman City. Five civilians were killed in this attack, 3 were brothers. The parents of the boys were rescued alive and 1 brother was pulled from the rubble. pic.twitter.com/8TV9Qxmc5f
